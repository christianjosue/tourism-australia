            <h4>Experience of<br><span>traveling</span></h4>
        </div>
        <div class="experience-container">
            <p>Although we encounter many <span>cultural differences in our travels</span>, it is actually incredible how similar we
                are to people who live across the globe. Despite our diverse cultural backgrounds and daily lifestyles,
                travel allows us to connect with others and realize that we actually have a lot in common with that one
                friend living in Sweden. We also enjoy spending time with family, listening to indie pop music, and
                dancing on the weekends.
                <br>
                Once we’ve pulled ourselves outside of the safe, protective bubble of home, we can clearly see that we
                are just like those people hundreds of miles away. <span>We are all a part of a bigger story</span>; we all have more
                bringing us together than tearing us apart. It’s this realization that breaks down fear and prejudices,
                making the world a much smaller, more welcoming, and connected place.
            </p>
            <div class="experience-img"></div>
            <p>Traveling helps us feel like our best self because we are more willing to receive the world’s many
                lessons, no matter their shape or size. It helps us recognize our shared humanity with others and
                dissipates <span>fear or misunderstandings</span>. After all, it’s much more fun to love the world than to be afraid
                of it.
                <br>
                In travel, we <span>find the best in ourselves and in others</span>. We become the person that we had hoped we would
                become as a child: an explorer, open to <span>meeting new people</span>, and learning new things. And maybe, just
                maybe, someone who is brave enough to eat scorpions off a stick.

                        <p>The city has several specialized beaches for surfing. It is a popular tourist sport among
                            national and international tourists. The Cape Byron Lighthouse is one of the city's
                            attractions,
                            helping with whale watching, which in turn is a very important industry and contributor to
                            the
                            local economy.
                            <br><br>
                            Temperate and tropical waters abound in Byron Bay, making it a popular area for diving and

                            considered the most ecologically friendly beach in the world, the cleanest beach on the
                            planet and even considered one of the most paradisiacal beaches on Earth.
                            <br><br>
                            This Australian beach got the 1st position in this study that named the eight most

                            beach on a stretch of white sand, set against a backdrop of ocher and red cliffs and fringed
                            by the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean. <br><br>
                            A camel ride along the beach at sunrise or sunset is a must, immersing yourself in the
                            pearly romantic history of the Kimberley town and its multicultural society.

                            <br>
                            Wineglass is famous for its perfect horseshoe shape, white sand and turquoise waters. But
                            also because of its natural environment, surrounded by bays and mountains, far from the
                            bustle of other typical beaches.
                            It is worth doing the Freycinet Experience Walk, a path that surrounds the entire area.

                            melaleuca trees. Walk around barefoot, choose a bike instead of a car and buy fresh seafood
                            for a sunset barbecue on the beach. You can hire a kayak and paddle right off the beach or
                            take a tour to nearby Double Island. The Palm Cove jetty is a great fishing spot, with
                            plenty of Spanish mackerel, cod, whiting, stripeys and flathead to be caught.

                            limestone needles that protrude from the sea on the coast of Port Campbell National Park, in
                            Victoria, Australia.<br><br>They were formed by rock erosion and movement along the Great
                            Ocean
                            Road. The proximity of one to the other is the cause of the curiosity of the place and what
                            has made it an important and popular tourist attraction.

                            (Australia), at the entrance to the Gulf of Saint Vincent. Its closest point to the mainland
                            is 13 km from Cape Jervis, at the tip of the Fleurieu peninsula, in the state of South
                            Australia. The island is 150 km long and between 900 m and 57 km wide; comprises an area of

                            Another of Australia's mythical, you can only find him in the nature reserves of Tasmania.
                            It is the largest carnivorous marsupial, such as a cat or a small dog, in existence today,
                            it gives off a super strong odor and screams like crazy. So... a small animal that has well

                            in the Blue Mountains, about 50km west of the city.

                            On the other hand, throughout the country there are some parks and sanctuaries specialized
                            in this type of fauna, such as the Healesville Sanctuary, located in Melbourne.
                            <br><br>
                            Anatomically, to the naked eye, an Australian Dingo can be very similar to a domestic dog.
                            However, the dingo really is a one-of-a-kind canid.

                        <h5>Sidney</h5>
                        <p>Sydney, the capital of New South Wales and one of Australia's largest cities, is famous for
                            its harborside Sydney Opera House, with its distinctive sail-shaped design. Massive Darling
                            Harbor and smaller Circular Quay are hubs of riverside life, with the arching Sydney Harbor
                            Bridge and the renowned Royal Botanic Gardens nearby. Sydney Tower's outer platform, the
                            Skywalk, offers 360-degree views of the city and suburbs.

                        <h5>Canberra</h5>
                        <p>The location of Canberra was selected for the position of the national capital in 1908 as a
                            compromise between Sydney and Melbourne, the two great cities. It is different from other
                            Australian cities in that it was built from scratch, as a planned city.
                            <br><br>It owns the vast majority of government and political departments, such as
                            Australia's parliament and supreme court.

                        <p>Lake Hume is an impressive body of water held by an awe-inspiring dam wall and is an easy
                            15-minute drive from Albury Wodonga. There’s something for everybody at Lake Hume.
                            For the adventurous, there is wakeboarding, water-skiing, tube-riding and stand-up
                            paddleboarding.
                            For those who like a gentler pace, the foreshore is the perfect place to enjoy a picnic,
                            fire up a barbecue and experience the mountain views while you connect with friends and
                            family.

                        <p>Yes, it’s home to Australia’s highest peak, but that’s not all: Kosciuszko National Park
                            offers travellers a whole world of spectacular to explore. Three ski resorts (and a fourth
                            currently being rebuilt) are the centre of human activity here: ski or snowboard the
                            country’s highest runs, or test your legs on a cross-country skiing odyssey. Take on
                            big-challenge walks, saddle up and ride the High Plains, explore caves, or just find a
                            people-free lookout and simply breathe in the beauty and tranquillity.

                        <h5>Kiama</h5>
                        <p>It could be the rhythmic hum of the breaking waves, the reassuring wink from the iconic
                            lighthouse, or the ‘whoosh’ from one of the world’s biggest blowholes. Kiama’s relaxing
                            coastal vibe has an instant effect. The name Kiama is from its Wodi Wodi Indigenous name
                            Kiaram-a, to which some sources give the meaning “where the sea makes a noise”.<br>Kiama boasts several popular surfing beaches and
                            caravan parks, and numerous outdoor cafes and restaurants.

                            been chosen for many consecutive years as the best city in the world to live.<br>
                            It is also a very large and multicultural city; With a population of close to 5 million,

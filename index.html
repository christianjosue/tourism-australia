                languages were spoken across the nation. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
                Islander Studies has produced this map detailing the languages used across Australia. Barani, an

            <p>The Commonwealth of Australia was created in 1901 with <span>the Federation</span> of all the states. It was
                agreed
                that the capital could be in NSW but no closer than 100 kilometres from Sydney. This led to the
                <span>creation
                    of Canberra</span>, with a temporary parliament set up in Melbourne for 27 years.

                Both New Zealand and Fiji were invited to join the Federation of the states but declined the

                        I

                        ANZAC
                        Day - the date Australians remember and pay respects for the sacrifice of our Armed Forces,

                    <p>The end of World War II, and then subsequently the Vietnam War, led to an <span>influx of migrants
                        to
                        Australia</span>. The Snowy Mountains Scheme (1949 - 1974) employed 100,000 people, with 70% being
                        migrants from <span>30 different nations</span>. Steady Asian migration began in the 1970s, and now
                        people
                        from all over the world call Australia home. This is reflected in many aspects of Australian
                        life, with Australian society known for its equality and lack of clear <span>class distinctions.</span>
